# VECA Framework
VECA (Vanilla Environment & Components Architecture) is a lightweight JavaScript framework designed for building single-page applications (SPAs). It emphasizes simplicity and performance by leveraging vanilla JavaScript, which means it doesn't rely on additional libraries or frameworks.

Key Features:

1. **Component Architecture**: VECA enables developers to create reusable UI components, fostering code maintainability and adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

2. **Routing System**: It provides a straightforward yet robust routing system, simplifying the management of different views within the SPA.

3. **State Management**: VECA includes a state management solution to facilitate the sharing and management of data across components, streamlining the development of complex applications.

4. **Vanilla JavaScript**: As its name suggests, VECA is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, ensuring familiarity and avoiding the need to learn a new syntax or use specific build tools.

5. **Lightweight**: VECA prioritizes performance by keeping its framework lightweight, making it suitable for projects where performance is a priority.

## Project Structure:

VECA follows a modular project structure, with directories and files organized to separate concerns. For example, components, router, and state logic are segregated to maintain clarity and modularity.

## Development Workflow:

The project utilizes npm for package management and includes scripts for development and testing in the package.json file. It employs live-server for serving the application with live reloading, enhancing the development experience.

## Third-Party Assets:

VECA integrates third-party assets like Bootstrap for styling and UI components, enhancing the visual presentation of the application.
